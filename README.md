A python library for creating and analysing simple mechanisms. 

## Description 
This python project is about mechanical systems and mechanisms. Personally, I find mechanical systems fascinating as they can exhibit a rich array of behaviours and can be readily observed in the real world through beautiful motion. I wanted to create a project where I can learn more about mechanisms and at the same time document my learning through a python project. Any feedback would be welcome! As the library gets larger I will update key information here. 

## Status 
Under development.
